# This Dockerfile is used to define the environment and instructions for building a Docker image.

# Base image
FROM golang:1.20
# It specifies the base image, installs necessary dependencies, and configures the application.

# Base Image:
# The FROM instruction specifies the base image to use for the container.
# It is recommended to use a lightweight and secure base image.

# Installing Dependencies:
# RUN instructions are used to execute commands in the shell during the build process.
# These commands typically include installing required software packages or libraries.

# Copying Files:
# The COPY or ADD instruction is used to copy files or directories from the host machine
# to the container's filesystem.

# Setting Working Directory:
# The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
# It simplifies file paths and ensures commands are executed in the correct context.

# Exposing Ports:
# The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports.
# This is used for communication between the container and the host or other containers.

# Running the Application:
# The CMD or ENTRYPOINT instruction specifies the command to run when the container starts.
# It is typically used to start the main application or service.
